# Green_House_Automate
In this project we have developed a system that can automatically irrigate, could maintain the temperature and humidity requirement by using specially designed Peltier fan, use Compact Fluorescent Lights for faster growth during night (automatic on/off), all the automated process is controlled by ARDUINO UNO.
